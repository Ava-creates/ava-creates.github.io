# Madonna in a fur coat 
At first, I found this book a bit full of cliches, but then I realized it was written in 1943, which makes it quite novel. I enjoyed the setting of the book, both time and location-wise. The protagonist was too poignant and passive for my liking. I did like our initial narrator, though. Maria's contemplations on the nature of love in relation to the self resonated with me. I often feel disconnected from my environment and question the nature of human relations, getting to know that people have felt the same and have been writing about it felt absolving. My feelings about the lack of feelings were expressed in the book better than I can express them.
