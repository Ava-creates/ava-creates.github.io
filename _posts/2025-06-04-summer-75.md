# Summer 75 

May 25, 2025 - August 08, 2025

My summer 75 rules look like this - 

## Body
* 6 days a week run and gym alternation 
* One fruit per week
* 50g of protein per day

## Mind
* 10 pages of any book per day (read during my commute)
* One LeetCode question per day
* One blog post here per week (reflection is important)

I want to include research stuff here too, but I think it is more varied -- in general, I am staying on campus from 11 am to 7 pm, working on research and going to the gym. 

I will likely be posting interesting research updates and weekly updates from this challenge, too. 

I already feel so much more confident in the gym after Week 1.
