Hello, I am Avani (it is pronounced Avni)!

I am working on automating DSL(Domain Specific Language) generation using an LLM-driven iterative approach, where LLM is guiding the search. Feel free to reach out to discuss this in detail!

Between reading papers and running experiments, I enjoy reading a healthy amount of literary fiction sprinkled with some non-fiction! You can find the books I have read and my thoughts on them in the books read section. I am always looking for book recommendations!

Like every computer scientist, I have been thinking of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and what is the true nature of intelligence.
